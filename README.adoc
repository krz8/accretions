Accretions is a collection of data structures that aren't present in
standard Common Lisp.
Of course, we already have lists, and most CL implementations have
performant hash tables.
But there remain other data structures essential to certain
applications that are missing from the standard.
Accretions is my collection of good (or, at least useful)
implementations of them.
If I've needed it more than once, and the code is good enough, here is
where it winds up.
footnote:[Yes, I'm through re-implementing these wheels from scratch,
over and over...]

Accretions would not exist without the essential work of Donald Knuth,
Robert Sedgewick, Jon Bentley, Doug Hoyte, and others.

Certainly, Accretions isn't alone in its implementations.
With the slightly possible exception of ternary search trees,
everything in here must already exist, scattered somewhere on the
web.
footnote:[No, I haven't checked personally.]
But performance isn't always discussed, and it's never clear how tight
or loose the code is.
Here, each algorithm or container comes with at least _some_ analysis
of how well it's likely to perform in practice.
It hopes to be a little faster, maybe a little more efficient, and
maybe a little more consistent than other implementations out there.


== Functionality

=== What You Get Now

Bags:: Also known as Multisets, these are simple unordered collections
  of items.
Ternary Search Trees::
  A really nice collection filling the space somewhere between hash
  tables and tries; great for dictionaries!
  The Accretions implementation allows for any key sequence, not just
  strings.
  It provides the functionality of a trie without the unfortunate space
  overhead.
  footnote:[Especially in this age of Unicode.]
Red-Black Trees:: Notes on 2-3 and red-black go here.
Hash Tables:: The Common Lisp standard is built around a *sxhash*
  function that cannot be replaced and a fixnum-based hash space.
  Accretions offers a hash table implementation that allows for updating
  hash algorithms, evaluating alternate algorithms (_e.g.,_ Murmur,
  CityHash, FarmHash) as well as functions provided by the client.

=== What You Need

:quicklisp: https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/[Quicklisp]
:fiveam: https://github.com/sionescu/fiveam[FiveAM]

Strictly speaking?::
Nothing.
Individual lisp files can be compiled or evaluated as you need.
Accretions is written to the Common Lisp specification, and relies on
no external systems or packages in its source.

Loosely speaking?::
If you want to use the *asd* system definitions that come with Accretions,
you'll need ASDF 3.1.2 or later (along with associated systems like UIOP).
This should be no problem, every major lisp environment is already
including even later versions ASDF, and has been for years.

Very loosely speaking?::
If you want to run the tests that are packaged in Accretions, then you'll
need the {fiveam} test framework.
It's available via {quicklisp}, so if you have that, {fiveam} is but a
**quickload** away.

=== What You Will Get in the Future

{quicklisp}:: I'll submit this for packaging via {quicklisp} once I feel
  it's good enough.
More Containers:: Or more algorithms? Feel free to suggest something!

=== What You Probably Won't Get

I've experimented with functional data structures (as described by
Osazaki) and it's true, they have very promising characteristics in
persistence and safety.
However, their (albiet temporary) overhead in space can be prohibitive
for larger applications, and so I'll revisit this another time if I
can.
Especially, I encountered some _very_ interesting approaches,
including treating data as streams instead of contiguous blobs of
memory that really bear further investigation.

Okay, so go hit the {manual}!
